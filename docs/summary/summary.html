            <p>
                A thirst for knowledge has always been a strong asset for me.
                I firmly believe that a thirst for knowledge is what will keep me relevant for the entirety of my career.

                To date I have learned 6 languages and countless frameworks. All of them having a specific relevance to a project I was working on.
                Each language or framework allowed me to reaffirm that languages and frameworks are simply tools in an ever growing toolbox.
                Most importantly these allow me to better choose the right tool for any given job.

            <p>
                As a father of 4 I find that a work life balance is a critical part of my life.
                It is important to me that I find the space for my creative mind time to work.

                As a rock climber I am constantly reminded about what attention to detail can mean.
                A simple mistake rock climbing can lead to a very bad day.
                The physical strain coupled with this gives me an understanding for how to maintain focus even in the most stressful environments.

                As a home brewer I am given a creative outlet to artistically manufacture craft beer.
                The combination of cooking and chemistry allow me to exercise my creative and analytical mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                I find that having balance in my life is what lets me perform at the highest levels in a sustainable way.
